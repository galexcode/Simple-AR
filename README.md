## Augmented Reality project

The origin of the project is a simple need : show on a video flux some
data dependent on the azimuth of the phone.

There's some info, coming from Amnesty just to show how to get those
from Google.

This project, even if there's an heavy rewrite for most of the part,
come from https://github.com/zac/iphonearkit
TBXML http://www.tbxml.co.uk/TBXML/TBXML_Free.html is heavily used.

Can compile with Xcode 3.x normally, and compile fine with XCode
4.3.3, so just open the project an run it.
